Basically just putting this together so I can gather texts and grind through some of the greatest philosophers in history. Based on this Quora post https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-read-the-works-of-great-philosophers-In-what-order-should-I-read-them . Definitely not complete - feel free to add more!

I listed the texts in chronological order - do not feel compelled to read them as such! Actually the author of the above Quora post suggests reading them non-linearly, so feel free to follow that order if you'd like as well.

It's not necessarily recommended to just jump into reading these original texts - having some frame of reference is often considered a good idea. You can get this by taking college level philosophy classes, reading history of philosophy books, or many other ways.

I've been getting my feet wet listening to Philosophize this (http://philosophizethis.org/) - shout out to Stephen West for making it! If anybody has any of their own resources for starting out, feel free to raise an issue or make a PR putting them... somewhere.

Finally, feel free to add yourself in `checklist.csv` and mark down the list as you go! Who will finish first?? Is the goal even to finish?

Happy philosophizing.
